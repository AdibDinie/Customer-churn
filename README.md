# Customer Churn Analysis

## Introduction
Customer retention is a crucial challenge in the telecommunications industry. With increasing competition and numerous service options, companies need to understand why customers leave (churn) and how to proactively address their needs.
This analysis explores the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains various customer attributes including demographic information, account details, and the services they use. By identifying patterns associated with churn, the business can implement targeted strategies to improve customer loyalty and satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
The increasing churn rate has become a growing concern for the telecom company, as it directly affects revenue and puts pressure on customer acquisition efforts. Understanding why customers are leaving is critical for sustaining long-term growth. This project aims to explore and analyze customer behavior to uncover the key factors contributing to churn and provide actionable insights to help the company enhance customer retention.

 ## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution and characteristics of churned vs. retained customers.
- Explore the impact of demographic variables (e.g., gender, senior citizen status) on churn.
- Examine how account-related features like contract type, tenure, and payment methods relate to customer churn.
- Identify the services (e.g., internet, phone, streaming) most commonly associated with churn.
- Provide initial insights that can guide business decisions to reduce churn.
